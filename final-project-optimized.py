                I'll pass you feelings and you will analyze the feeling of each message, 
                and will give me an swer with at least 1 character and as maximum 4 characters, 
                ONLY NUMERIC ANSWERS, in which -1 is maximum negativity, 0 is neutral and 1 is the maximum positivity. 
                You can do among those values, meaning 0.3, -0.5 etc are also valid.
                You can only answer with ints or floats'''
